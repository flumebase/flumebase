FlumeBase is a Java application with a maven-based build process.

BUILD SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
  * Maven 2.0.9+
  * Java 1.6+
  * git
  * Linux, or other POSIX-like environment (e.g. cygwin)


INSTALLING PREREQUISITES:

The following prerequisite tools must be installed prior to building
FlumeBase:

  * Apache Thrift compiler 0.5.0
  * maven-thrift-plugin 0.1.10


  Installing Apache Thrift:

Apache Thrift can be downloaded from http://incubator.apache.org/thrift.
Download the 0.5.0 release of Thrift, untar it, and build it with
./configure && make && sudo make install.

Make sure that 'configure' indicates that Java libraries will be built.

You may need to download some of Thrift's build dependencies first. See
http://wiki.apache.org/thrift/ThriftRequirements (and the links at the
bottom of that page) for instructions on installing all Thrift build
requirements.

Correct installation can be verified with the following commands:

  $ which thrift
  /usr/local/bin/thrift
  $ thrift -version
  Thrift version 0.5.0

  If you run 'thrift --help', you should verify that 'java'
  is listed in the "Available generators" section.


  Installing the maven-thrift-plugin:

To integrate thrift in the Maven build, a specific plugin must be
downloaded from github.com/flumebase/maven-thrift-plugin. Clone the
repository, build, and install the plugin by running the following:

  git clone git://github.com/flumebase/maven-thrift-plugin.git
  cd maven-thrift-plugin
  mvn package install


RUNTIME PREREQUISITES:

  FlumeBase requires Cloudera Flume 0.9.3 and Hadoop 0.20. These can
be installed from Cloudera's Distribution for Hadoop version 3b4 (CDH3B4).
Installation instructions for CDH are available at
http://archive.cloudera.com.
  Installing from yum or apt-get is the most straightforward method. If
you install from release tar.gz files, then you will need to set
$HADOOP_HOME and $FLUME_HOME in your environment.

  You can also run FlumeBase with a Cloudera Flume git repository. Clone
a copy of github.com/cloudera/flume, build it (run 'ant'), and set
FLUME_HOME to the path to your repository. You do not need to separately
install Hadoop in this case.


BUILDING FLUMEBASE:

Finally, build FlumeBase itself by changing to the FlumeBase source directory
(the directory containing this COMPILING.txt file) and running:

  mvn package

Unit tests can be executed by running:

  mvn test

(This is done as a sub-step of 'mvn package'.)

More thorough (longer-running) integration tests are available at:

  mvn integration-test

The FlumeBase shell can be run with:

  bin/flumebase shell
